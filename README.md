Data analysis on different data sets

In this project, the objective is to analyze the exit surveys of employees to know the level of satisfaction with the work. The data comes from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We will attempt to provide an answer for these 2 questions:
- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?"
